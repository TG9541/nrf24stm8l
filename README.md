# nrf24stm8l

STM8L051F3P6 board with an nRF24L01+ module, a 32.768KHz crystal, and a CR2032 battery holder for prototyping wireless sensors. [STM8 eForth](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/) support for nRF24L01+ (or SI24R1) is [work in progress](https://github.com/VK6TT/stm8ef-nRF24L01-).

The HackaDay project [STM8 eForth Wireless Sensor][HAD1] explores using this PCB.
